# tddKata

For CS372 Spring 2019
Homework 2
By Jonathan Aarhus

This is a the result of a tdd kata I performed, to create a test of a function that performs a prime factorization.
One of the quirks of this design is that the function being tested is assumed to take a reference to a vector.
This was besed on the assumption that the function would take an empty vector and fill it with the prime 
factors of the integer input.

I didn't bother wrighting an actual prime factorization function because the point of this exercise was just to 
do the kata for the test program.
